Some simple changes to Cow & Sheep recolor, 
added black wool and chicken egg item they have no purpose atm
could not figure out how to modify textures of sheard sheep and baby animals
added chickens front and back sprite kinda iffy and they are small but chickens should be small dont know why they rabbits are almost as big as the character in this game


do what you want with this stuff I may start modding game again when more free time and better documentation 

thanks
